Rain is a reward for STARFLIP \r\n                    users to collect while they are actively playing on the site as part of our free \r\n                    to play system. Abusing rain contrary to its intended purpose may result in \r\n                    termination of your account at STARFLIP's sole discretion.</p>\r\n                    <p>8.2 STARFLIP also deploys another rewards program called \"daily cases''. Daily \r\n                    cases are allowed to be opened by users once per day depending on their correlated \r\n                    level on STARFLIP. STARFLIP provides a daily case that is unlocked once per day to \r\n                    users as part of our free-to-play system. To gain access, they must simply link their \r\n                    Discord account and join our discord server. Once doing so, the user is able to open \r\n                    the case once per day with the same odds as anyone else who uses the website. STARFLIP \r\n                    has the right to adjust the case contents and percentages of every daily case at its \r\n                    discretion.</p>\r\n                    <p>8.3 Please note that the Rain feature listed on STARFLIP has guidelines set in place to \r\n                    prevent users from abusing it. We are unable to list every method a user is able to abuse the \r\n                    rain. If a user is caught abusing the rain while using STARFLIP as a free-to-play method, their \r\n                    access to our service will be immediately terminated.</p>\r\n                    <p>8.4 Wager farming to receive higher rewards from rains, etc., is prohibited and may result in level reduction or a permanent ban.\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                            <li>Users creating and using multiple accounts to claim rains at the same time are subject \r\n                            to account termination across every account ever used on STARFLIP.</li>\r\n                            <li>Users joining and tipping their claimed funds to other users without properly using \r\n                            said funds to play the games listed on our site are subject to account termination across \r\n                            every account ever used on STARFLIP.</li>\r\n                            <li>Users claiming multiple rains and allowing them to build up their balance without using \r\n                            the coins to genuinely participate on the games listed on our site are subject to account termination \r\n                            across every account ever used on STARFLIP.</li>\r\n                            <li>Users depositing the minimum amount to claim rains every 2 week period without using the site as a \r\n                            free-to-play feature are subject to account termination across every account ever used on STARFLIP.</li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p></p>\r\n                    <p></p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"list-element\">\r\n                <div class=\"element-title\">9.
